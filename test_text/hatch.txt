And he sat all that day
And he kept the egg warm
And he sat all that night
Through a terrible storm.
It poured and it lightninged!
It thundered! It rumbled!
This isnt much fun,
The poor elephant grumbled.
I wish shed come back
Cause Im cold and Im wet.
I hope that that Mayzie bird doesnt forget.

So Horton kept sitting there, day after day.
And soon it was Autumn. The leaves blew away.
And then came the Winter, the snow and the sleet!
And icicles hung
From his trunk and his feet.
But Horton kept sitting, and said with a sneeze,
Ill stay on this egg and I wont let it freeze.
I meant what I said
And I said what I meant
An elephants faithful
One hundred per cent!
