I went for the kind that were mellow and sweet
And the worlds sweetest eggs are the eggs of the Kweet
Which is due to those very sweet trout which they eat
And those trout well, theyre sweet cause they only eat Wogs
And Wogs, after all, are the worlds sweetest frogs
And the reason theyre sweet is, whenever they lunch
Its always the worlds sweetest bees that they munch
And the reason no bees can be sweeter than these
They only eat blossoms off Beezlenut Trees
And these Beezlenut Blossoms are sweater than sweat
And thats why I nabbed several eggs from the Kweet.
