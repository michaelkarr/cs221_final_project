every time you
tell your daughter
you yell at her
out of love
you teach her to confuse
anger with kindness
which seems like a good idea
till she grows up to
trust men who hurt her
cause they look so much
like you

your art
is not about how many people
like your work
your art
is about
if your heart likes your work
if your soul likes your work
its about how honest
you are with yourself
and you
must never
trade honesty
for relatability to all you young poets

Surround yourself with love
Fall into it
Hold it close
Love yourself so much
You cant help but love others
But do not go looking for love
In those who made you feel alone
In the first place
