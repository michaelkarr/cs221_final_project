This was no time for play.
This was no time for fun.
This was no time for games.
There was work to be done.
All the deep, deep, deep snow
All that snow had to go.
When our mother went down to the town for the day,
She said, Somebody has to clean all this away. Somebody, Somebody has to, you see.
Then she picked out two somebodies: Sally and me.

Well there we were.
We were working like that
And then who should come up
But the CAT IN THE HAT!
Oh-oh! Sally said. Dont you talk to that cat.
That cat is a bad one,
That Cat in the Hat.
He plays lots of bad tricks.
Dont you let him come near.
You know what he did the last time he was here.
Play tricks? laughed the cat. Oh, my my! No, no, no!
I just want to go in
To get out of the snow.
Keep your mind on your work.
You just stay there, you two.
I will go in the house and find something to do.
Then the cat went right in!
He was up to no good!
So I ran in after as fast as I could!
Do you know where I found him?
